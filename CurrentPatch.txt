/rpa edit description add The user is rooted into place, being unable to move, or use any other Ability or Mundane Technique except for Enchanted Buffer, or Enchanted Wall. While Enchanted Buffer is maintained, the user can grant up to 5 HP to any Target (or multiple) person, in any desired combination, which is applied through a Link Power while this affects them. Additionally, the user becomes Immune to any type of Displacement, meaning the only way to cancel this Ability is either by choice, or by attacking the user in Melee. When the Ability is ended, it goes on a 2 Hour Cooldown.
